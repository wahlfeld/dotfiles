## Git-less download

```
mkdir -p $HOME/projects && cd $HOME/projects && curl -L https://github.com/wahlfeld/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv
```

## Setup dotfiles, brew, few other things

`./setup`

Note: You may need to restart your Mac in order for the terminal font to work correctly.

## Todo

* Fix issue where installer stops after brew installs
* iTerm2 preferences include my name instead of $HOME
